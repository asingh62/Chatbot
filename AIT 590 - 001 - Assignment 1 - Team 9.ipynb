    "# This program is developed by Team 9 of AIT 590-001 section. \n",
    "# The team comprises of 3 members : Prateek Chitpur, Amrita Jose and Asmita Singh. \n",
    "\n",
    "#This is a program, coded in Python, for a chatbot named Eliza. Chatbots are software applications used \n",
    "#for conducting online chats by mimicking human speech in order to simulate conversations with humans.\n",
    "#Chatbots are artificial intelligence programs and make use of natural language processing techniques to\n",
    "#simulate natural human conversations and simplify human interaction with machines and computers. The \n",
    "#chatbot Eliza in this program, is a psychotherapist that was initially developed by Joseph Weizenbaum \n",
    "#at MIT, Cambridge. The application made use of pattern matching and substitution methodology\n",
    "#with interaction directives written as scripts using MAD-Slip.\n",
    "\n",
    "#This program is an attempt to implement Eliza using Python scripts. The program makes use of word spotting\n",
    "#and keyword identification techniques in order to generate meaningful responses to the input. It also \n",
    "#transforms statements from the user to questions wherever necessary to convince the user to engage in relevant\n",
    "#conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "# We are spotting words related to user's greetings, name, request(please), need, words related to user's family, \n",
    "# words related to user's emotions(love/hate), definite answers (Yes/No), sorry, thank you etc. Mostly we are \n",
    "# converting statements regarding user's emotions (happy/sad/angry/love/hatred and so on) \n",
    "# and relationships (father/mother/husband/wife/child and so on) to questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#A few examples of user input and Eliza's responses and the usage instructions are as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Eliza (at the beginning of the program) : \"Hello! I am Eliza, a psychotherapist. What is your name?\"\n",
    "#User : \"Hi my name is Team9\" (Instructions : User can also type just Hi, Hello, not type anything\n",
    "#and just type enter, or wait a few seconds before typing anything - Eliza will give corresponding \n",
    "#responses to everything!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Eliza : Hi Team9. It is nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?\n",
    "#User : I feel depressed. (User could also say \"I need help\", \"I feel/am feeling/am sad/sick/depressed/\n",
    "#/angry/afraid/lonely\" and Eliza will respond accordingly.)\n",
    "#Eliza : Talk to me about these feelings (or Can you explain that feeling more?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#User : I miss my mother (User inputs cover a wide scope with all possible immediate family relationships)\n",
    "#Eliza : Tell me about your relationship with your mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "#User : I really don't know what to say.\n",
    "#Eliza : What makes you think that?\n",
    "\n",
    "#User : Well my mother was an amazing person.       \n",
    "#Eliza : Your family and loved ones will be the true well wishers of your life. \n",

    "#*************************** Step by Step description of the Program.***********************#\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. The algorithm used in this program fetches the patterns/keywords in user input using regular expressions and \n",
    "#assigns corresponding responses to the input. \n",
    "#2. The program begins by Eliza introducing herself and asking the name of the user. User could respond with or \n",
    "#without a name and Eliza will respond accordingly. User's input is passed into a function 'eliza_chat()' that iterates\n",
    "#through the user input regular expression patterns and corresponding responses in a master list called 'regexlist'. \n",
    "#Based on the pattern, a matching response is selected randomly from the pool of responses.\n",
    "#3. The response is then passed into the 'eliza_tokenize()'' function that tokenizes the user input and uses the \n",
    "#'replace' dictionary to convert first person pronouns to second person pronouns and vice versa.\n",
    "#4. Eliza's response is returned and printed.\n",
    "#5. This loop keeps iterating until the user quits, exits or bids goodbye (wide scope of responses for farewell)."
